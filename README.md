# Kirby-Adventures
My first ever game, through Greenfoot API and Java. Its VERY lacking in visuals, I was limited in using greenfoot API, 
which was a beginner friendly software and had limit visual effects. I created this in 3rd year high-school, but looking back to it 
the visulas are pretty lacking, and a lot of the naming doesn't follow styling rules... Might fix them and make the game better some day.

The game can be played in the attached site.
